Roadmap:

- 0.2: new JavaScript API
  - Implement hypseg DONE
  - Implement FSG creation/setting DONE
  - Implement adding words DONE
  - Compare C and C++/embind sizes DONE
  - Wrap C API with JS objects, handle memory management DONE
  - Implement configuration from JSON/Object DONE
	- Parameter normalization as in Python
	- Return configuration as JSON
	- To Proxy or not to Proxy? NO, won't Proxy
  - Async API
	- we may still want to run it in a worker but this will mean less work later
	- ps_init is a factory function so let's make it one in the API
	- decompose ps_reinit into chain of promises
	  - config -> lmath -> acmod -> dict -> d2p
	  - all of these are async
	  - some are long-running and need to be decomposed further
		- acmod in particular:
		  - fe -> feat -> mdef -> {tmat, mean, var} -> mgau
  - Very simple alignment example
	- Load wave file into browser using readDataAsURL
	- Enter text into a text field
	- Click align - show times, words become clickable
  - NPM setup
  - Write API tests
	- Using what framework? MochaJS?
  - Write API documentation
	- Manually in Sphinx-RST
- 0.3: fix various Python APIs and remove code
  - Translate back from JavaScript into Cython/Python ;)
  - FSG construction API is quite bad (no error handling for invalid
	inputs, forgetting start/end state)
  - FSG and search names need to GTFO
	- No, just need to synchronize them properly
	- Useful to be able to identify an FSG object
- 0.4: phone-level alignment
